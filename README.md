## Release
### Toolkits
> [**EasyRobust**](https://github.com/alibaba/easyrobust/tree/main/easyrobust): a toolkit for training your robust models, with a collection of **adversarially robust** / **non-adversarially robust** / **standard** training method on **CNN** / **ViT** architectures.

### Image Classification
> [**RVT**](https://github.com/alibaba/easyrobust/tree/main/RVT): strong baseline for robustness research on vision transformers. Paper link: [Towards Robust Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07926)

### Objection Detection
> [**D^2ETR**](https://github.com/alibaba/easyrobust/tree/main/ddetr): decoder-only DETR with computationally efficient cross-scale attention on transformer backbone. Paper link: [D^2ETR: Decoder-Only DETR with Computationally Efficient Cross-Scale Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00860)
